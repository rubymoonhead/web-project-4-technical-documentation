						<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="blank">Hugo</a> is a
						popular open-source static site generator written in the Go
						programming language.
					</p>
					<h3>What is a static site generator?</h3>
					<p>
						Per
						<a
							href="https://www.techradar.com/best/static-site-generators"
							target="_blank"
							>techradar</a
						>, a static site generator like Hugo takes all the source
						files and creates a static website out of the source files.
					</p>
					<p>
						A static site generator is a system that lets a website
						creator use certain code sections repeatedly and easily.
					</p>
					<h3>What is Go?</h3>
					<p>
						According to
						<a href="https://golang.org/" target="blank">Golang.org</a>,
						"Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy
						to build simple, reliable, and efficient software."
					</p>
					<p>
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)"
							target="blank"
							>Wikipedia</a
						>
						says that "Go is a statically typed, compiled programming
						language designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob
						Pike, and Ken Thompson.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, "Go is widely used in production at Google and
						in many other organizations and open-source projects."
					</p>
					<p>
						Hugo's main selling point is that it's fast. It takes seconds
						to generate a site with lots of pages. Site generation speed
						prompted <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, a website that provides
						content and resources for web developers and web designers, to
						switch to Hugo from Wordpress.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hugo has great
						<a
							href="https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/hugo/"
							target="blank"
							>Markdown support</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Hugo site includes a table of
						<a
							href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/"
							target="blank"
							>content formats</a
						>. In the table you'll notice that HTML and Markdown are
						supported.
					</p>
					<h3>What is Markdown?</h3>
					<p>
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"
							target="blank"
							>Markdown</a
						>
						is lightweight markup language. You can create formatted text
						using a plain-text editor.
					</p>
					<p>
						"John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a
						markup language that is appealing to human readers in its
						source code form.
					</p>
					<p>
						Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online
						forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and
						readme files." Markdown is readable as-is without looking like
						Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML.
					</p>
					<p>
						We skimmed through the Markdown tutorials provided in the Hugo
						site. It appears it's easy to learn Markdown syntax in a
						single sitting. According to
						<a
							href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/"
							target="blank"
							>Markdown Guide</a
						>
						"It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once
						you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just
						about everywhere."
					</p>
					<p>
						Other Hugo features are that it can support dynamic API-driven
						content without plugins, has hundreds of pre-made templates,
						provides full support for multi-language sites, "allows you to
						output your content in multiple formats, including JSON or
						AMP, and makes it easy to create your own."

						Hugo might have a steep learning curve for people who have
						never coded and beginner web developers.
					</p>
					<p>
						It would be best if you have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, CLI
						(command line input) to install Hugo to your Windows, Linux,
						or Mac computer, know how and be willing to write your content
						with Markdown, and know how to use Git for content version
						control and to deploy your site.

					<p>
						If you plan to create your blog using Hugo, you must install
						Hugo on your computer. You can also install Hugo on Windows,
						macOS, and Linux.
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll focus on installing Hugo on Windows 10 in this
						documentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						After install, you must create a Hugo PATH, verify the
						executable, then create the Hugo site.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Folder Setup</h4>
							<p>
								The starting point for your new project will be
								<code>C:\Hugo\Sites</code>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>C:\Hugo\bin</code> will store executable files.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									In Windows Explorer create a new folder:
									<code>C:\Hugo</code>. You can set up Hugo anywhere in
									your computer. For now we'll stay with
									<code>C:\</code>.
								</li>

								<li>
									Create a <code>bin</code> subfolder in the Hugo
									folder: <code>C:\Hugo\bin</code>.
								</li>
								<li>
									Create a <code>Sites</code> subfolder in Hugo:
									<code>C:\Hugo\Sites</code>.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Download and Extract Hugo</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Go to the
									<a
										href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases"
										target="blank"
										>Hugo Releases</a
									>
									page.
								</li>
								<li>
									Click on the latest release. The release has a
									"latest" button. Go down the list and choose the
									applicable Windows zip file to download.
								</li>
								<li>
									We're downloading the
									<code>hugo-0.89.4_Windows-64bit-zip</code>.
								</li>
								<li>
									Download the zip file into your
									<code>C:\Hugo\bin folder</code>.
								</li>
								<li>
									Extract the zip file into the same
									<code>C:\Hugo\bin folder</code>. You should see three
									new files: The Hugo executable
									(<code>hugo.exe</code>), <code>LICENSE</code>, and
									<code>README.md</code>.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Create a Hugo PATH</h4>
							<p>You must add Hugo to your Windows PATH settings.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Right click on the <em>Start</em> button.</li>
								<li>Click on <em>System</em>.</li>
								<li>
									Click on <em>Advanced System Settings</em> on the
									right.
								</li>
								<li>
									Click on the <em>Environment Variables…</em> button
									on the bottom.
								</li>
								<li>
									In the User variables section, find the row that
									starts with PATH (all caps).
								</li>
								<li>Double-click on <em>PATH</em>.</li>
								<li>Click the <em>New…</em> button.</li>
								<li>
									Type in the folder where
									<code>hugo.exe</code>
									was extracted, which is
									<code>C:\Hugo\bin</code>. The PATH entry should be
									the folder where Hugo lives and not the binary.
								</li>
								<li>Press Enter when you’re done typing.</li>
								<li>Click OK at every window to exit.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Verify Hugo executable</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Open a Command Prompt.</li>
								<li>
									Type <code>hugo help</code> and press the Enter key.
								</li>
								<li>
									You should see output that starts with:<br />
									<code
										>Hugo is the main command, used to build your Hugo
										site.<br />
										Hugo is a Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator
										built with love by spf13 and friends in Go.</code
									><br />
								</li>
								<li>
									If you see something similar to the above output,
									then the installation is complete.
								</li>
								<li>
									If you don’t, double-check the path that you placed
									the
									<code>hugo.exe</code> file in and that you typed that
									path correctly when you added it to your PATH
									variable.<br />
									If you're still not seeing the output find solutions
									in the
									<a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/" target="blank"
										>Hugo discussion forum</a
									>
									or go to the support category of the discussion forum
									and request help.
								</li>
								<li>
									At the prompt, change your directory to the Sites
									directory:
									<br />
									<code>C:\Program Files> cd C:\Hugo\Sites</code><br />
									<code>C:\Hugo\Sites></code>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Create a Hugo site</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Run the command to generate a new site. For example,
									using
									<code>namedsite.com</code> as the name of the
									site:<br />
									<code
										>C:\Hugo\Sites> hugo new site namedsite.com.</code
									><br />
									You should now have a directory at
									<code>C:\Hugo\Sites\namedsite.com</code>. Change into
									that directory and list its contents.
								</li>
							</ul>

					<p>
						You can choose from a variety of
						<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" target="blank"
							>Hugo themes</a
						>
						and apply the theme to your site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Download the current version of the theme and unpack the zip
						file in your <code>themes/chosentheme</code> namedsite.com
						folder.
					</p>
					<p>
						Find the <code>config.toml</code> file, a configuration file
						that lets you set different options for the site, in your
						<code>namedsite.com</code> folder. Open the file with Notepad.
						Add <code>theme = "chosentheme"</code> below your blog's
						title. You can further customize your
						<code>config.toml</code> file later.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the command line run <code>hugo serve</code>. Open
						http://localhost:1313 in your browser, and you should see your
						live site.
					</p>
					<p>
						You'll see your site's home page. There will be a list of
						posts. Choose “Creating a New Theme”. Open the file
						<code>content/post/creating-a-new-theme.md</code> to revise
						the post. Once you save said file, your website will
						automatically update with revisions you've made. Create a new
						post by creating a new Markdown(file extension .md) file with
						a file name you prefer. Now you can focus on creating your
						content. Start writing your content.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want, you can deploy your site for free using Netlify
						or Now or GitHub Pages. Be sure to get your own domain name
						though.

					<h3>Pros</h3>
					<p>
						Hugo is easy to learn and set up, and has great documentation.
					</p>
					<p>Hugo has a growing active open-source community.</p>
					<p>
						Hugo is lighter than Wordpress and Hugo is great for content
						managers/web developers who prefer simplicity over a barrage
						of extensions and plugins they feel they don't need.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since Hugo is a static site generator and the static site
						generator runs on your personal computer, your site is not
						accessible to anyone but you. Your website loads faster, and
						there is no database behind your site that might slow down
						load times when a user is on your site.
					</p>
					<p>
						With Hugo, your HTML files are rendered on your computer. You
						get to review your files locally before they're hosted in the
						HTTP server. Your HTML files aren’t generated dynamically.
						Site performance is faster. HTTP servers excel at sending
						files and serve a number of pages with a fraction of memory
						and CPU resource required for dynamic sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Faster websites can rank better on search engines, so Hugo
						benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a static website, you don't need provider-hosted servers.
						You can use web developer platforms like Netlify, Now, or
						GitHub pages to host your Hugo site.
					</p>
					<h3>Cons</h3>
					<p>
						Hugo is not like a Wordpress site where you can edit content
						in a WYSIWYG admin window.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hugo's learning curve might be steep for some since you must
						understand the basics of Markdown, some coding, and Git.
